<h1>Arduino</h1>
<p>The arduino example is preferred as it's much more effecient on performance, power consumption and additioanlly more functionality.</p>
<p>In order to get it working with the Arduino you will first need the Arduino IDE</p>
<p>https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software</p>
<p>After you have installed which for your desired platform open the file in the IDE and flash the Arudino with the arrow pointing right at the top of the IDE.</p>
<h1>Raspberry Pi</h1>
<p>The raspberry pi is not the reccomended option as it's function is limited and much less efficient for the code than the arduino but if it's for a simple hands on project it works absolutely fine.</p>
<p>In order to get this setup, flash the Raspberry Pi with the latest version of Raspbian Server, or Raspbian Lite as it's called on the website. The link for which can be found here.</p>
