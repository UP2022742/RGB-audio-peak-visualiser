<h1>Universal</h1>
<p>The universal code should work for any operating system which will allow the use of Python which includes Linux Distros, OSX and Windows. The reason for Python being the universal option is due to the fact most operating systems support it but unfortunetly it carries a heavy load so regarding the sockets it's best to keep it to a minimal.</p>
<h1>Windows</h1>
<p>The client in Windows is written in C# with built in forms.</p>
<h1>OSX</h1>
<p>The client in Windows is written in C++</p>
<h1>Slaves</h1>
<h3>Arduino</h3>
<p>The arduino example is preferred as it's much more effecient on performance, power consumption and additioanlly more functionality.</p>
<h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
<p>The raspberry pi is not the reccomended option as it's function is limited and much less efficient for the code than the arduino but if it's for a simple hands on project it works absolutely fine.</p>
